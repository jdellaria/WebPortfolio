The original source was from a tutorial which I modified significantly to meet my specific requirements. The original git is the following:
https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-react-and-spring-data-rest/tree/master

to run local
./mvnw spring-boot:run

the access web site by

http://localhost:8080/

to run behind the scenes, locally
nohup ./mvnw spring-boot:run  &


clean package
mvn clean

build package
mvn build

Prepare package (this builds the jar file to be deployed to a web server or to cloud foundry)
mvn package


Deploy to bluemix - this command is required because the default buildpack is Liberty which does provide web capabilities, but does not provide the auto connection to the data source without adding the data source name to the code.

bluemix app push WatsonNLUJD -p target/watsonnluweb-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -b java_buildpack

to deploy to Pivotal Cloud Foundry

cf push WatsonNLUJD -p target/watsonnluweb-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
