Deploy to bluemix - this command is required because the default buildpack is Liberty which does provide web capabilities, but does not provide the auto connection to the data source without adding the data source name to the code.

bluemix app push WatsonNLUJD -p target/watsonnluweb-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -b java_buildpack
